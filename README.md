# MentorHive

**MentorHive** is a tool for private tutors and professors to find teachers and manage logistics, including a calendar, file sharing, and a chat system. This is my first project with the MERN stack, and I found it intuitive and fun. Authentication, filtering, and DB access are handled by the Express.js backend.

NOTE: The project is **unfinished** and not fully developed, which is **not** something I usually do. Check my profile for more complete projects.

## Why MongoDB?

MongoDB is ideal for MentorHive because it handles unstructured data, like user profiles, class materials, and chat messages, seamlessly. Its flexible schema allows easy updates as the app evolves. MongoDB also scales horizontally, ensuring the app can handle increasing numbers of users and data as it grows. This makes it a great fit for the dynamic, ever-expanding needs of a tutoring platform like MentorHive.

## How to run the DEMO?

The only required technology is `Docker`. You can simply run the project from the root directory by using:

```bash
docker compose up
```
